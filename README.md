# BiblionasiumDigitalCitizenship

Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to look over my digital citizenship landing page. This page was created to host <a href="https://www.biblionasium.com/" target="_blank">Biblionasium</a>'s free digital citizenship resources for teachers, librarians, and students.

After I got my HTML5 and CSS certs from <a href="https://www.frameworktv.com/" target="_blank">Framework Television</a>, I wanted to put my new skills to use in a real-world setting. Marjan Ghara, CEO of <a href="https://www.biblionasium.com/" target="_blank">Biblionasium</a>, had commissioned me to create Biblionasium's digital citizenship program, so I offered to design a landing page for it from scratch. 

Before creating the landing page, Marjan and I reviewed similar products and agreed on each element that should be included. We reviewed brand materials and standards and came up with a general outline for the page. 

Instead of creating a wireframe and prototype first (which I should have done), I dove right into coding. It ended up being a long and arduous process because I didn't go in with a plan. I learned from this mistake and decided that designing web pages and mobile apps with either Figma or Adobe XD prior to coding is the way I want to do things from now on. 

I chose a gif for the header (branded with Biblionasium's logo at the top left, which is the brand standard) to draw the reader's eye and create movement on the page. Following the header is a brief introduction to the program with a cute stock illustration (via <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a> Plus), which was also used as part of program materials.

After the introduction, we included bullet points with the program's main highlights, a download link to the full ZIP file, and a short video with an overview of digital citizenship for kids.

Marjan asked me to include rectangular elements which are also present on other Biblionasium <a href="https://www.biblionasium.com/learn_more" target="_blank">pages</a>, so I coded the "rectangles" section as a follow-up to the bullet points.

Underneath the rectangles are another section that is similar to the Biblionasium <a href="https://www.biblionasium.com/learn_more" target="_blank">Learn More page</a>, stylized bullet points which I coded from scratch using the bullet image that was on the site.

Finally, individual sections for teacher materials, printables, and a digital citizenship pledge are included with links to the materials, which can be found on the <a href="https://blog.biblionasium.com/" target="_blank">Biblionasium Blog & Help Center</a>. 

Each section of the page was optimized for mobile with percentages, -em sizing, and a media query. 

Coding this landing page was an educational process and I think the end product will fit in well with Biblionasium's existing branding and design. The page is pending a rollout after final changes are made to the learning materials.
